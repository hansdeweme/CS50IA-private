This repo contains my solutions for the Harvard CS course Introduction to AI with Python.
All have been checked with check50 as 100% complete and correct; style50 rates the coding style as mostly 100 but sometimes 98 or 99
because it insists on splitting lines even when I think this is not needed ;D)

Feel free to use this code!
a thank you would be appriciated
